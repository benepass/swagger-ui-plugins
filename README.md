## Contributing

Feel free to open issues and pull requests that fix bugs, add functionality, and introduce new plugins.

I will make releases of each plugin when/if your PR is accepted.

## Versioning

Each plugin uses [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. 

A plugin's version is unrelated to its Swagger UI compatibility: compatible versions are indicated by the plugin's Swagger UI `peerDependency`.
